# Github-Interrogation
This repository is used for the final assignment in CS3012. It will be used to extract details from Githun and return a visualization of the extracted data

### The language for this assignment that I will be using is Python. It will be my first time using the language, and from searching on the internet it looks to be the best recommended within the time frame allowed. By time frame allowed I mean with all other assignments happening around me, Python seems easiest and hopefully does the job.
