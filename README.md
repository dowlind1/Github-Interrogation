# Github-Interrogation
This repository is used for the final assignment(Github API access and then visualization) in CS3012. It will be used to extract details from Github and return a visualization of the extracted data

## Recent Update
### I have extracted data from the github api, represented the data in a form of visualizing a separate webpage. From there you can also view the users followers followers on a dendrogram tree style. This D3 aspect was requested in the final assignment of this project. I have limited the amount that it will go through so none repeat as this would seem like an infinite loop if the initial user was to be called upon again. 

### The pages are uploaded to the Trinity server and can only be viewed there: Viewed at https://macneill.scss.tcd.ie/~dowlind1/CS3012

### It is an interactive and user friendly page, it works instantly as characters are input

## Using HTML, CSS and Javascript(along with AJAX and JSON)
### Why did I change... I need to make a website for another assignement and enjoy doing so. I heard there were others in CS3012 doign websites, so I decided to look into it and found good help videos for accessing the github using Javascript and it was a personal touch as I preferred the representation of the website. It is more user friendly. As I progress I will have it displayed on my macneill.scss.tcd.ie/~dowlind1/CS3012 server in college. I will be attaching code in here also to show the progress and steps, aswell as insight when developing.(D3 still a separate level but who knows, I might actually get there...)

## Changed
### I initially went with Python and then found most of my colleagues were attempting to use RStudio to access the Github API, because I already knew the language I changed to this. Reason for this was, learning Python was a good experience, but as I progressed I realized that the Python is only as good as the knowledge of the libraries within and how to use them aswell as learning how to use JSON.

## Changed
### The language for this assignment that I will be using is Python. It will be my first time using the language, and from searching on the internet it looks to be the best recommended within the time frame allowed. By time frame allowed I mean with all other assignments happening around me, Python seems easiest and hopefully does the job.
